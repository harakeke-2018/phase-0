What did I do well this week?

I think I understood the content well this week, there were a lot of new concepts and ways of looking at / thinking about design and layout but I felt like it all made sense.

What could I have done to improve?

I could have finished this sprint by last Wednesday like I wanted to! I definitely need better time management and to put blocks of time aside to focus on absorbing the content better.

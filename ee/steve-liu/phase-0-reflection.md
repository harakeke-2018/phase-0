1. What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

The first thing is that I persevered. I completed nine sprints in five weeks, which is very intensive. I have ever thought to drop it, but in the end, I finished it.

During Phase 0, I have developed a reasonable workflow (or habit) that is used by most web developers. A good habit will be able to greatly improve work efficiency.

At same time, I have mastered lot of technologies that I do not know before, such as git, many APIs of Javascript. I also completed some challenge including js-calculator, and minesweeper.

The meditation is good thing. I guess that it must be useful to me.

2. What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

Through these sprints, I was able to improve my codeing style. I learned to make code more clearner and more compact. The most important thing is that I was more likely to focus on my work. I can concentrate on doing something longer and longer.

3. What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

As I mentioned, the technical skills, the reasonable workflow, and the attention will help me overcome the Bootcamp.

# Sprint 8 Reflection

**What did I do well this week?**

Before starting work on the Calculator project, I created a wireframe diagram of how I wanted it to look. I also wrote a whole lot of pseudocode for the programming logic necessary. I used an object as my data structure and then created a number of methods within this object. I haven't done this before so I was quite pleased with the way that things turned out.


**What could I have done to improve?**

I tend to focus on the computing/programming aspects of the course work ahead of other things like mindfulness and (this week) the personal check-up exercise. Then when I've finished the programming work, I have a whole lot of other things to do. I guess this means that I'm negatively prioritising some things. I think I could do more to improve my work balance by spreading the load and concentrating on the big picture and not just the bits that I like better.

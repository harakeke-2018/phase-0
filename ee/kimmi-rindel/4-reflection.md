What did I do well this week?

I stuck to my schedule and will have completed this sprint in just less than a week â€” an achievement! When problem-solving more complicated problems in the code academy and code camp javascript tutorial I managed to keep relatively calm and did not get too frustrated.

What could I have done to improve?

I have been finding it especially hard to concentrate recently. I could have most likely pushed through and have gotten more done this week, or at least have tried harder to gather my focus. This is not so much a problem now though.

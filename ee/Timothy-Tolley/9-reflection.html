What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?
I think over the last 12/13 weeks I've learnt so much about the world of coding. I'm pretty proud of what I've already achieved which is awesome. I think I've been a pretty quick learner and have been striving to keep my work up to a high standard. I read the entirity of the search inside yourself book which I'll be honest I never expected to do - I usually skim read most things at the very least! I think I've done well to perservere when I've struggles and I'm pretty happy with my creations as a result. My final project for the javascript section showed me that I was able to work through the problems as I was able to complete what I wanted to achieve from the beginning without needing the help of others. I've made a lot of progress understanding the different languages and feel comfortable using CSS, HTML and Javascript too to an extent and am looking forward to learning more about them in bootcamp. My positivity is still very high and although I've been super busy I have managed to finish the prep with a nice amount of time to regroup and catch up on the few things I thought I could have learnt more fully throughout the prep. I feel like I've had a pretty good work/EDA/life balance over the time and am glad that I got the work done while also enjoying my summer. I've also started doing a little bit of written reflection outside of the course but still about my learnin process which is pretty cool. Pretty happy with what I have achieved!

What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?
I think that I could have been more strict on myself in terms of timeblocking out sections of my evenings to work on the projects rather than just working when I fit it in. I think I could have been more focused on learning to touch type over the last 2/3 months. I think that now that I'm finished I will need to really knuckle down on that to get it sorted before january - my typing is pretty quick but I would like to be able to touch type in order to be more efficient. I definitely dont think I took enough notes throughout the phase 0 experience and have since started to take some down. I will definitely revisit each sprint in order to take notes and revise before the bootcamp so perhaps that will work in my favour. I need to practice make more regular commits in order to keep a better working log. I always forget to send through my git commits. I also think I need to do some outside reading to be sure I'm up to date with the updates in the languages and the tech world in general. In terms of the work itself I think I am pretty on top of things and I am happy with what I've achieved - I think I will improve on my blog and look forward to learning new and exciting things in the new year!

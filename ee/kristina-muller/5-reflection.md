What did I do well this week?
Not so much, I didnt give myself enough time to study each concept so I dont really think I picked up as much as I wanted to. But I did learn how javascript interacts with HTML and CSS.
What could I have done to improve?
I guess I could have spent more time on really getting a grasp on each of the components and fully understanding the concepts.

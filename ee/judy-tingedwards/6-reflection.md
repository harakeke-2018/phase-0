1. What did I do well this sprint?
I asked for help. I went into EDA and talked to Don about me being really stuck on the Minesweeper challenge.

2. What could I have done to improve?
Not getting angry and blaming my own intellect for not solving the problem. Took a big confidence hit this sprint even though I was really excited to make a real live game.

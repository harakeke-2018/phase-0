What did I do well this week?
I completed codeAcademy Javascript. This was very hard and constantly my focus would wander and I would find myself doing trivial unrelated tasks (as well as non trivial).

What could I have done to improve?
After completing cultural blog 4, perhaps by mindfulness training and in particular mindfulness activity I may be able to train my focus back to the problem at hand.

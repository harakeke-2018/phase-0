What did I do well this week?
Definitely the revising of Sprints 4, 5 and 6. Learning all about JavaScript loops, arrays, objects, functions, methods, accessing the DOM, making changes to the DOM, the console log! Oh, I can tell you all about JavaSCript but can I ....

What could I have done to improve?
Apply my newly revised knowledge of JavaScript to develop my Minesweeper task in Sprint 6.3.

I don't know why I am stuck. Well, I should say, I don't know why I'm allowing myself to 'procrastinate' just because I am stuck.

Learning JavaScript is just like learning to speak another language. I always tell my students that they should start speaking with what ever level of knowledge they have. But, like my students, I want to know the whole language before I start speaking it. This is not realistic and can even be detrimental to the whole process.

Ok, I will tackle sprint 6 and complete is by next week, promise!
PS - I have a new favourite song, painted black by the Rolling Stones. I sing it every time I have a go at changing the CSS on my web site.

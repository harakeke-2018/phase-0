Sprint 5 - Reflection

What did I do well this week?

I worked well on the technical resources and managed to fix the responsive design problems on my blog (thanks to Harrison!).

What could I have done to improve?

I am still having trouble staying motivated when it comes to the completing the blogs. It's not something that comes naturally to me and I need to bring better effort on these tasks.

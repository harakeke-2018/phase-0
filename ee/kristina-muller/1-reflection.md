1. Why is reflection important?
Reflection is important to bring awareness to what has happening for you in this process. Looking back on what you have learnt and what you are learning is valuable tool to have because it helps you to navigate through what are learning from a broader perspective.
2. What did I do well this week?
What I think I did well, verses what I actually did well, are two very different stories. I did well at getting frustrated very quickly because I was not clear on where or what the supporting material was for the first assignments. However once I realised how the whole system is set and how to navigate each of the new applications that I was interacting with, I understood what the tasks were and how I should complete them.
3. What could I have done to improve?
I feel theres room for improvement in my stubornness to move on from what I am doing when I am stuck. I tend to just keep going and going at the same problem until solve it (or have a tantrum) which takes up to much time. I know I am very detailed oriented, and I need to know how it works or what the issue before I can move on, because it stays in the back of my head and then I can't relax.

Sprint 2 - Reflection

What did I do well this week?

I felt much more comfortable working in the Terminal and using GitHub. I have also been helping in the #code-help-desk slack channel where my knowledge permits.

What could I have done to improve?

I didn't do a great job of managing my time during the week and left too little time to complete the sprint during the weekend. I will be setting aside a couple of nights during the upcoming week where I can focus on the next sprint.

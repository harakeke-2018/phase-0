Sprint 1 - Reflection

Why is reflection important?

Reflection lets you examine what you have actually learnt in a topic, allowing you to identify areas that you need to go over again or that you might need to ask for help with. It also helps you evaluate what has and hasn't worked well in your study so that you can modify your study methods accordingly.

What did I do well this week?

I did most of the waffle assignments on Saturday and was happy with how well I stayed focused and avoided distraction.

What could I have done to improve?

I need to get better at planning out how I will devote my time during the week. I spent too much time on the resources before starting the assignments.

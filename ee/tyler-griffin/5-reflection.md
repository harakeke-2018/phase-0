What did I do well this week?
This week was hard, not going to deny. I am slowly getting my head around multiple for and if statements and iterating over multiple arrays. While still complex for me I feel it will become easier with practice.

What could I have done to improve?
I feel that I struggle to understand what my code is doing to a degree. PsuedoCode would help but I feel that my knowledge on basic javascript principles still needs to improve. Through repetition and practice I feel I will get more competent.

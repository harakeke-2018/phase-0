What did I do well this week?
I have been efficient with my time, and I spent lots of time on my Self Care exercise which I think was super important. I am going to EDA on Friday to spend the day on the last few exercises of sprint 8.

What could I have done to improve?
Well, I don't think anything at this current stage. I am happy with my progress for this sprint :)

What did I do well this week?

I have been paying closer attention to my own habits that are not-so-great and working to change them positively. Exercising, getting enough sleep and reading (many) books make up a new routine that has been helping me through depression and avoidant behaviours â€” things that have been holding me back from fulling committing the time I have now to Dev Academy. Accomplishments for this week are more so emotional than technical; I've found only some of the work technically challenging, which has been nice.

What could I have done to improve?

Getting started on projects causes me a lot of unnecessary emotional stress. Previous methods of light self-discipline are obviously not working so I am trying to change my approach to something more holistic (as mentioned above). That being said, there were times this week that I had given in/up too easily and lost sight of these goals.

What did I do well this week? What could I have done to improve?

When I first saw the assignments for this sprint, I thought it would be very
difficult and long, but I think I managed to get through it alright. There's nothing on my mind that I feel I didn't understand or didn't get through properly.

I did struggle with some of the exercises, as I wasn't taking the time to think about the steps logically. In hindsight I think I got frustrated and gave up a bit too easily, as I could have taken a bit longer on a few tasks.

Reading through the reflection resource, one phrase that stuck in my mind was that even just 5 minutes at the end of the day, with pen and paper and a cup of tea, can be a meaningful chance to reflect. I think I should try and do the same after having spent a while studying, to go over what I've learnt, what I've struggled with, and how to recognise and approach problems better for the next sprint.

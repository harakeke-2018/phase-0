# Sprint 5 Reflection

**What did I do well this week?**

I have managed to get through Sprint 5 in about 16 hours. I'm happy with that and feel that it has been more of a refresher course than new material I've needed to learn. I also have an idea for a project that I want to start working on. The project will utilise some of the ideas covered in this Sprint.

Something else that has happened in the past couple of days is that one of the other students finally merged my tidying work from Sprint 2 and gave me the opportunity to do the same for him. It was good to get that off my Kanban board.

**What could I have done to improve?**

Quite frankly, not a lot. I'm happy with my progress and the way that things are going.

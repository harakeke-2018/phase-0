<h3>What did I do well this week?</h3>
<p>
	Although I was tied up with other commitments I didn't give up and continued onwards. Even when the coding I was doing got unruly!

<h3>What could I have done to improve?</h3>
<p>
	There were times where I could have put time into doing the work but didn't. By reflecting on those times I can improve my time efficency.

Reflection - Tyler Griffin

In  my mind Reflection is important for reinforcing learnings. The ability to recap and analyse actions afterwards seems like it can bring massive improvements in information retention.

This week I have become more comfortable with slack and the team aspect of this style of learning. Additionally reinforcing git commands every assignment I have noticed some commands have become fluid.

In terms of improvements I feel like my actual html and css skills have dropped off since doing my own learnings and now due to being on holiday and just pure slackness. With the assignment structure the way it is I aim to develop small habits to allocate time accurately to complete the resources and more.

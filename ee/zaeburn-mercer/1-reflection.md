## Reflection

>Learning from direct experience can be more effective if coupled with reflection-that is, the intentional attempt to synthesize, abstract, and articulate the key lessons taught by experience.

### Why is reflection important?
Reflection builds one's confidence in the ability to achieve a goal (i.e., self-efficacy)
Learning can be augmented by deliberately focusing on thinking about what one has been doing.
### What did I do well this week?
I managed to organize my time so that I could study across 5 days this week.
### What could I have done to improve?
I could have time boxed the reading of material more strictly.

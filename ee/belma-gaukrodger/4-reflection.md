What did I do well this week?
Repeating the tasks:
I've completed some of CodeCademy tasks, not all
I'm still working through FCC tasks
Sometimes I dip into Treehouse

and I've found going over a concept or a set of steps helps me understand and 'register' the task. I keep saying to myself "Oh, I get it now!"

What could I have done to improve?
Well, repetition takes time! I don't know how many times I need to repeat each concept or task to feel confident that I know it or I can reproduce it on demand.

How proficient do we have to be in JavaScript and JQuery by the time the bootcamp starts?

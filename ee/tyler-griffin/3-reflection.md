What did I do well this week?
I am pleased with my progress on the technical blog, the redesign of my blog page and the process over product UX workflow.

What could I have done to improve?
Attention training. Often my focus strays. I have not yet committed fully to employing some form of mindfulness, emotional, attention training which as explained in the resources can have a profound impact on productivity.

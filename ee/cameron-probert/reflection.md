    Why is reflection important?
Reflection allows us to look back at the tasks we have completed, the problems we have faced, and the problems we have overcome. This retrospection allows us to examine what was effective in overcoming these problems, and what was not effective. We can therefore change our behaviour to use these more effective techniques.

    What did I do well this week?
I think I found time to work while working a full time job, which I thought was going to be quite difficult. It helps that the tools needed for web development (so far) are pretty easy to use on any computer. The only software that really needs installing is Git.

    What could I have done to improve?
I could have stayed more focused on during the time I was working on my projects. I am using the Pomodoro Technique, but did not delay everything external until after the 25 minutes were up. I did get much better at this towards the end of the week though.

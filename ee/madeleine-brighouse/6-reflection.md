What did I do well this week?
This week was stressful and frustrating with the mine game, just getting it to work how it should, but I'm proud of myself for using mindfulness and meditation to keep calm and clearish headed.

What could I have done to improve?
Allowing time to socialize and see people while i have the chance before bootcamp.

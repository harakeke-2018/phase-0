Why is reflection important?
I think reflection is important in order to understand where I am at after a weeks work. It also helps to consolidate all the ideas that I have been learning over a short space of time. Reflection allows me to recognize what I've struggled with and what I'm enjoying.

What did I do well this week?
I think I managed the tasks well and have enjoyed learning new things and completing challenges. I am interested in web design and all the tags and elements that need to be learned. I have enjoyed solving my own bugs and have got the hang of git nicely.

What could I have done to improve?
I could have spent more time working on the earlier stages and gained more of a solid base before diving into the challenge. I picked things up as I went along but missed a few key things along the way which meant I had to go back and look them up later. Could do with spending more time on the prep in the next sprint.

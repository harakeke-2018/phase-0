Sprint 6 - Reflection

What did I do well this week?

When I got frustrated I was tempted to copy someone else's code (for loops) and just move on. While I did use other peoples code as a guide in a few cases, I  made sure that I fully understood what was going on and used the for loops that we had been using up to this point as opposed to the for in loops most other people went with.

What could I have done to improve?

Struggled staying focused during the cultural blog exercise, partially because I was trying to rush through it. Will need to dedicate proper time to the blog in the next sprint.

Sprint 7 - Reflection

What did I do well this week?

Managed my time well and felt comfortable doing the pair assignment. 

What could I have done to improve?

I often find myself struggling to be motivated to do the blogs and in this sprint I skipped ahead to some of the sprint 8 assignments before finishing the cultural blog. I need to be better at working through the sprints systematically.

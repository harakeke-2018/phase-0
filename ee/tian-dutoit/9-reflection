Sprint 9 Reflection

What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I felt like I understand most of the material well and was able to work through any blocks by using the developer tools, setting an alert/console log or by googling. I was also happy with how well I stayed focused when I sat down to do a task as this is something I have struggled with in the past.


What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

At the start of phase 0 my goal was to finish the sprints before Christmas to allow myself time to review the material properly. I also wanted to interact as much as possible in the slack channel and during the weekly conference calls. Unfortunately I always felt like I was a running behind and while some of this was because I was time poor over the last few months and lacked some mental energy when the time was available, I should have organised myself and my time better.


What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

I have started a meditation practice that will I keep going throughout the bootcamp and I anticipate it being useful to have something to get out of the bootcamp headspace.

What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I think I did well at making sure things were completed to a high standard, although i didn't go over the top I made sure I focussed on process over product. My time management got better as the sprints went on.


 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Taken more notes, spent more time on the things I didn't understand so that I wasn't cramming everything in a week before bootcamp.

What did I do well this week?
This week I am happy with my progress in javascript. I am starting to develop skills enabliing me to form my own answers and structure for solving problems which is exciting.

What could I have done to improve?
To improve I am reading further into different loops and method definitions as well as different ways to define functions. It seems this can help obviously when coding but also searching the internet trying to debug code. Solutions can be written in a multitude of ways.

Why is reflection important?

You can look back on mistakes, learnings and wins you've had and both learn from and celebrate them.

What did you do well this week?
I followed tasks closely, and worked through them methodically. Also bookmarked a lot of resources which helped immensely, and became better at problem-solving instead of freaking out. Oh, and I already seem to have gotten into a good study habit.


What could you have done to improve?
Time management, because I didn't start working on stuff until Wednesday. I need to do as much as possible on Monday and Tuesday nights. Also had to study the entire weekend which was extremely draining and has meant I haven't been able to take a day off in weeks.

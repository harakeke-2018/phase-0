# Reflection 3
**What did I do well this week?**

There are a couple of tasks left to finish, but I thought I'd reflect now. I'm happy with my redesigned website, so I think that was a tick in the "done okay" column. Meditation is going well, to the extent that I'm looking at paying >$130 for a year's subscription to Headspace. I thought Skeleton was good, too. Not sure if I'd use it again, having had positive experiences with Bootstrap. I haven't done much wireframing before, although I've used Evolus Pencil with students. So I used that tool, rather than just the pencil and paper (although that happened first). I thought the results were okay.

**What could I have done to improve?**

Not a lot, really. It would have helped if I'd read the Skeleton documentation a little more closely. It might have been beneficial to do one or two practical exercises with Skeleton before embarking on the redesigns for my website.

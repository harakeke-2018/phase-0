Reflection is important because without it, things are less likely to be committed to our memory. Reflections helps us to learn.

I did well at keeping my cool this week - compared with last week. Last week I had no chill, and it got in the way of making progress. By comparison I have been a lot more calm and collected this week, and progress has come more smoothly.

I could have set myself a time limit on how long I spend working on a problem myself before asking for help.

Sprint 3 - Reflection

What did I do well this week?

I am happy with the overall design of my blog pages and managed to get some cool features in. Especially happy that I got the links to specific divs (blog posts) on the page working.  

What could I have done to improve?

I completely dropped the ball on completing this sprint in the time I planned. Some of this was due to after-work commitments I couldn't help, but I struggled to get back into my work routine once my schedule cleared. Going forward I will need to get my effort and focus back to where it should be.

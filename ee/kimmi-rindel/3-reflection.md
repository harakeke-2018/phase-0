What did I do well this week?

I'm focussing on being kinder and more honest to myself regarding my wellbeing, paying closer attention to habits that are not-so-great and working to change them positively. Exercising, getting enough sleep and reading (many) books make up a new routine that has been helping me through depression and avoidant behaviours.

What could I have done to improve?

Getting started on projects causes me a lot of unnecessary emotional stress. Previous methods of light self-discipline are obviously not working so I am trying to change my approach to something more holistic (as mentioned above). That being said, there were times this week that I had given in/up too easily and lost sight of these goals.

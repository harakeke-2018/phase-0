What did I do well this week?

I think I worked well through the work, made great notes and met other Harakeke members which was great! I did a lot better this week working on my meditation. I am also getting better at typing faster so soon hopefully that'll make it easier to practice touch typing.

What could I have done to improve?

I didn't have a lot of time to do the work - as much as I wanted to, so I'm a little disappointed about that but theres always next week! I also have done a lot better with remembering pausing and playing toggl when I'm working. I need to also spend more time practicing concepts a bit more.

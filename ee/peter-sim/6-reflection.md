# Sprint 6 Reflection

**What did I do well this week?**

I have managed to complete the Minesweeper (aka Micebeater) project to an acceptable standard. I was able to add sound effects and new graphics. I found an Audio Fx JavaScript library and used that to load and play the sounds. That worked out quite well.


**What could I have done to improve?**

I spent a lot of time trying to engineer a restart-game option, but in the end I decided to abandon that and run with what I had. The problems were that at the end of the game, the board would not redraw correctly if you lost, and there was an issue with sounds not playing properly. I guess I could have spent more time asking Harrison, but right now I just want to clear this one off the decks. If time permits, I will revisit this project and see if I can get things working properly.

What did I do well this week?
Finished my sprint quickly :) onto sprint-7 now!


What do you think you could improve on?
I think I could improve on the understanding of Javascript, take a bit more time to stop and try get my head around the content, rather than rushing to finish the sprints just to meet deadlines.

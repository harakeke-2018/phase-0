What did I do well this week?
I came into EDA and got through the rest of Sprint 5 which is great! It only took me a week to get through this sprint so I'm pleased, and want to make it an every Friday thing, at least.

What could I do to improve?

I definitely need to go over the resources several times before trying them, then give exercise a good hard crack before I look at someone elses code.

Why is reflection important?

- Reflection helps us celebrate our successes, and learn from our mistakes.

What did I do well this week?

- This week I made a really nice first attempt at my blog, and also didn't spend too much time on it (I wanted to spend more time but stopped myself, as it's good enough to move on with). I'm proud of myself for executing it, and getting most things I wanted in there.

What can I improve on?
- I definitely need to spend more time on Monday and Friday completing the exercises, without getting distracted. These are my two days to catch up!

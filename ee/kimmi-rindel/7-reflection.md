What did I do well this sprint?

I've become more confident writing code from scratch, with the help of online resources and patience.

What could I have done to improve?

Larger algorithmic problems are hard for me. This week, I did not spend much time trying to solve these more challenging problems as I became too frustrated. I could have made the effort to return to these problems later on but instead avoided it.

What did I do well this week?
This week I am happy with my achievements in working with APIs and while I am still terrible I feel like I am improving. I am also getting more confident with Javascript and searching answers on the web.

What could I have done to improve?
To improve I probably could have tried harder to do pair programming. It is hard while in a remote learning situation because we havn't actually met our fellow students yet.

This week I think I did well to get over the block I had with the calculator task. I knew I had a block but couldn't work out what it was so restarted and managed to get it by working through slowly and methodically rather than pushing forward too quickly. I think I would have benefitted from doing so from the beginning. I would have liked to be able to create an evaluation function by myself rather than using eval(); although I think it was good that I pressed on when I couldn't work out how to achieve this - will be looking back on it after questioning Harrison. I think I had a pretty good sprint!

What did I do well this week?
I worked hard on designing my site. And solved most of the problems that arose from the re-design by myself.

What could I have done to improve?
Again I could have time-boxed better. I spent a lot of time on this weeks assignment, luckily I am not working at the moment so I do have time to spare. But I think I invested more than I was suggested. However I think I learned a lot this week and it was worth it.

What did I do well this week?
This week I did well on moving on if I was getting stuck. I find it challenging to understand certain concepts that I know I would understand if it was verbally explained to me. But it can feel like banging my head on brick wall when I'm reading the questions or task over and over and not understanding what is being asked of me.

What could I have done to improve?
Would have been easier to have someone who I could ask questions to clarify. But otherwise, I could time manage more efficiently

What did I do well this week?

Consistency - I've done at least 1 hr of coding/reviewing/watching videos/pair programming this week.

Speaking of pair-programming, I think it's a brilliant idea! We should start doing pair-programming tasks from sprint 1. I have to admit though, I did about 1% of the work, and my partner did the rest, which is roughly 99%. I have huge amounts of gaps in my knowledge, and will probably need another 12 months to go over Phases 0, 1, 2 and 3!

But, I've made peace with myself that I won't be working as a web developer upon graduating from DevAcademy. I really need a good full year to get my head around everything. At the moment, I'm only finding out what I don't know. I'm also beginning to realise that it'll take me a long time to learn and put to practice what I learn about being a web developer.

Hence, I've accepted my fate that it'll be a long, steep curve for me during the bootcamp. I might even be totally lost! But I'm ok with that idea. I'm doing the bootcamp course at DevAcademy to become a teacher of web development. The best way to learn anything new (and exciting) is by teaching it to someone else.


What could I have done to improve?

I should have waited another year to do the bootcamp! I hope I don't waste my life-savings and actually get something out of the bootcamp in Jan/Feb & early March. I should have taken my time to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Right now, I feel like I'm rushing everything and nothing seems to stick unfortunately. This is really disappointing as I'd like to think that I'm advancing and progressing on solid ground, knowing all the steps along the way.

Right now, I feel like such a 'fake' and it's upsetting. BUT, I accept it, and will move on through the bootcamp. Then, I'll start learning coding afterwards :-)

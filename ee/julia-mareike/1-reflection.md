Why is reflection important?

To look back and take a moment to recognise achievements, and also be aware of things that didn't go well and consider how to avoid them in the future.

What did I do well this week?

I managed to block out some large chunks of time to focus on learning. A lot of html and css was familiar to me from many many years ago so was easy enough to pick up.

What could I have done to improve?

The best thing would have been to not get sucked into a vortex of git errors and google troubleshooting! It's all good now, but, took a few hours off my life. I definitely need to spend more time studying, and take the time to read through the resources before jumping straight in to the assignments.

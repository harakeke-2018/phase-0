Sprint 4 - Reflection

What did I do well this week?

Felt comfortable using with Javascript and stayed focused and motivated when working through the web courses.

What could I have done to improve?

I spent too long worrying about what images to put on my blog, which delayed me putting the links out the slack channel. Eventually I just put a single simple image on each blog and will go back later (time permitting) to make it a bit more appealing. Process over product!

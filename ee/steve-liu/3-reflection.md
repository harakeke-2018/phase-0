1. What did I do well this sprint?

In sprint-3, I have redesigned and rebuild my blog home page and blog-template page.
I created a wireframe by hand-painted, and then convert it into the html and css.
During this process, I was following the 'process over produce' step by step and took a complete process from web design to implement.

2. What could I have done to improve?

I have learned about the web development steps.
I divided all of the works into different parts.
a. design the wireframes.
b. convert the wireframes into html semantic tags.(first develop layout and container, then implement other elements such as title)
c. set up the style for the pages and specific element.(from big elements to small elements, form page to element)

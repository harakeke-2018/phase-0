Reflection (Zoe)

Why is reflection important? 
Reflection is important because, as indicated by research, it is what allows for learning and improvement. A lot of learning focuses on experience, however this only allows for short-term gains / understanding, whereas experience coupled with relfection allows for long-term understanding. Reflection also means that learners can use their mistakes in order to grow, as opposed to making a mistake and assuming they are therefore unable to learn / do something. 

What did I do well this week?
This week I have really gotten stuck into my EDA journey after the holiday period. It's been great to feel a little more familiar with the command line and with pushing changes to github. I didn't know what anything in that sentence meant before starting the sprint so that seems like a good beginning. 

What could I have done to improve? 
I've really struggled to sit down and find the time to work on things. Part of that is because it is a busy time and family / friends are on holiday so there's a lot going on, but mainly it's been because I haven't sat down really committed to working on the modules. I notiecd I have a tendency to look at the next tasks, decide I can't do it and then spend a good few hours worrying instead of trying to figure it out. I did notice I did this less and less as time went on however.

1. What did I do well this week?
I made a website that doesn't look too shabby! Actually realised that colours aren't everything - sometimes black and white looks pretty cool too.
2. What could I have done to improve?
I think I spent too long on getting the CSS. I could spend hours on making it pretty. That's probably why they recommend that I do meditation on the side haha. I was actually getting up early on Sunday morning making my website pretty!

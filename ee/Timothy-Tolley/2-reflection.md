This week I think I did well with the indentation task, although I think I needed to do more research about the rules than I had expected to have to. With the different tags and their meanings unknown in some cases it was hard to know where there were inline tags or not. I think I spent a reasonable amount of time working this week, but there is always room for more. I enjoyed the first chapter of the emotional intelligence book. I think I could have spent more time on touch typing this week but was pretty busy. I need to time-block more time out of my day to do work I think. I could do with practicing my mindfulness more often, and need to make a note somewhere so that I see it and remember to do it. Pretty good week in all and feel confident enough in giving myself a few extra days at the start of this week to finish phase 0 in time for bootcamp.

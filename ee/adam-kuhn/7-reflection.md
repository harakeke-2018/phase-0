What did I do well the week?
I tried something new with the Pairing Exercise. I thought Madeliene and I worked quite well together. I look forward to trying more pairing exercises in the future.

What could I have done to improve?
I felt rushed this week. I didn't get working on the assignments till late in the week and I felt rushed and pressed for time. I need to begin working on the assignments early in the week and not leave it all to the end.

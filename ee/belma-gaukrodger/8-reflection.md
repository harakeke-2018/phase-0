What did I do well this week?
As I've finished work for the year, I have more time to dedicate to Phase 0, most of which is spent on pair-programming. I really enjoy working with a partner who knows what to do! I hope one day I can also reach out to the Phase 0 cohort in the future and be able to offer some help. It'd be nice to pay it back and forward.


What could I have done to improve?
Refactoring - I don't really know what to do with my calculator? I think I'll need to read up more about it and go over it next week. I just wanted to close this ticket and move on.

I really enjoy the challenge of learning to code but I have so much more to learn, practise and hone in. All in good time, I know. If I don't get ready for the bootcamp, there's always life beyond the bootcamp. I'll polish my skills then.

Why is reflection important?

Putting how you're feeling into words is very useful as to alleviate any stresses or anxiety. Having to reflect additionally provides you with the space and time to understand and contextualize the work you have been doing.

What did I do well this week?

Committing to, and keeping up with a busy schedule.

What could I have done to improve?

I think making sure to revise some of the content learnt last week before carrying on with projects. I'd probably make less mistakes and be less confused when beginning assignments for the week.

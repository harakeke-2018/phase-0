# Sprint 9/Phase 0 Reflection

**What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?**

I think I did most things well in terms of the material to be learned. I have taught a good deal of it, so a lot was revision. I worked hard and got through things in a timely way. I also helped others in the Phase 0 group. I turned up for check-ins every Wednesday. I have been open to new ideas like mindfulness and I'm continuing to meditate for 10 minutes every day.

**What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?**

Not much more than I have done. For me it has been about seven weeks and I think I am quite well prepared for the bootcamp.

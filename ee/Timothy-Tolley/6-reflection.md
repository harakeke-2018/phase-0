This week I think I did well with the minesweeper task - it was nice to get some things moving and see how javascript could make things happen and actually have them work too! Little bit daunting knowing how many different types of different events and methods and functions etc there are but I'm sure theres a trick to remembering all that. Otherwise I was impressed with myself for asking for help a few times. It was nice to get help from my peers. Unfortunately I haven't been able to make it to check in for a few weeks due to work commitments so feeling a little isolated on that front. I think I could have done a bit more reading around my issue before asking for help - it was a gap in my knowledge that was an issue there but it was good to have a bit of guidance on that front. Been a busy week with family staying and a new work schedule but I feel like I got all the work done to a pretty good standard. Still need to type more - might have to do that after the sprints are over and before bootcamp!

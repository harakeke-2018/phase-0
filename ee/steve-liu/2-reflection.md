In this week, I am working on the tasks of the sprint-2. Some of them are what I have known and some of them are new. 
I have learned the CSS layout concept, adaptive design, and the amazing CSS framework - Bootstrap.

1. What did I do well this sprint?

In this sprint, I have got a better understanding on the CSS layout concept. And I have used the Boostrap to implement the layout of my technical blog.
I also got a good understanding on what is the grid based design. Through timebox, I was able to spend more time on working. 

2. What could I have done to improve?

English is still my obstacle. I spent much more time to read 'Search insight youself'. I plan to read 2 pages English book every morning to improve my English reading.
I know 2 pages are too little to most of people, but I guess I should start building my confidence by completing some little things.

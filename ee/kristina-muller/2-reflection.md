What did I do well this week?
I don't think I did anything particularly well this sprint. I have taken a long time to finish, but once I started and go over the really challenging aspects, everything flowed.
What could I have done to improve?
I know I need to discipline myself more, and I find myself always getting mentally blocked if I am technically blocked for a good chunk of time. I feel like I cannot move forward or continue until I complete each assignment in the correct order. And so when I get blocked I need to move on and not worry about not knowing the answer.

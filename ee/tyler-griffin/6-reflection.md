What did I do well this week?
This week I feel like I made some meaningful ground with javascript. While the majority of the complex code was essentially copied from other students or was completed with the help of other students. Never the less I am still happy with my progress.

What could I have done to improve?
To improve I feel like I need to begin to form my own methods for completing tasks. Although without the guidance of the EDA steps for each sprint I would not have been able to complete most of the work. I would like to build toward this over the next few sprints.

What did I do well this week?
I asked for help when I needed it. I definitely needed some guidance throughout the minesweeper assignment so it was great to talk with others. I tried out new things (adding sound, and randomizing the board), they didn't often work right away but I eventually figured out a solution.

What could I have done to improve?
I still need to work on commiting more often. Also after looking at others codes I need to find more efficient solutions, and comment on my code more often. Commenting on code seems to be a great way to keep everything clear.

Why is reflection important?
Reflection is important because it's a window to your soul. That's when you stop and think about your actions, decisions, and any consequences they make bring. You basically step out of yourself and look back at yourself from outside. Sometimes I can be highly critical of my actions, sometimes I may be overjoyed with what I've achieved that particular day or week. Both processes are important and require 'maturity'. Sometime we can be too hard on ourselves, and that's not healthy.
What did I do well this week?
Despite going over 2 weeks for sprint-1, I feel I've managed to stay on task (with a head full of cold too!)
What could I have done to improve?
I must manage my time better! 
E tata tapahi, e roa whakatu (Procrastination is the thief of time)
I'm learning to ask for help at my full-time job and on the EDA slack channel. Things are looking up already!

What did I do well this week?
I think again once I stopped stressing and got over my 'perfectionisim' it made it easier to do the work. I also am proud of what I achieved because it was close to what I planned to create. Some things I feel may be a bit too advanced for right now.

What could I have done to improve?
This sprint I was really busy with things such as doctors appointments, interviews/work and family events that it was hard to get a lot of work done, but the little blocks I did have were great. It was hard to be really motivated with so many other aspects of life all squeezing in. Not sure how I could have improved on this as I did my best to find little blocks of time for things and at least practice typing and shortcuts which I did occasionally but for those small things I forgot to record on toggl and am unsure how long I really spent. Hoping I can have better blocks of time for the next sprint.

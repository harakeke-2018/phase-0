What did I do well this sprint?

I've learnt so much this sprint(!) and so have finished this sprint feeling more capable, positive and a bit smarter.

What could I have done to improve?

I received a lot of help this week from friends and family who know how to code. The downside to this is that I was not very self-reliant and did not do a large amount of independent research to help me get un-stuck. Although, I've learnt a lot more about JavaScript, so I don't see this really as a bad thing.

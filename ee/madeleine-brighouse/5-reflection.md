What did I do well this week?
This week, well this past two and a half weeks. I have managed my stress levels well, even tho I've fallen behind study wise.

 What could I have done to improve?
Again I can work better on-time management but mostly on my typing practice and atom shortcuts. And meditating every day (i've been forgetting now and then).

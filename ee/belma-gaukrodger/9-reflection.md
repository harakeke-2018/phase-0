What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

Well, I kept composure and never cried once! So, I never lost my cool, and I'm thrilled about this! But, I was stuck on so many occasions that I seriously think I'm not ready for the boot camp.
Let me explain the reason why I feel that way, and you can decide for yourself :-)
I'm a slow and careful learner, to the degree of being pedantic! I take notes, re-watch videos, repeat instructions... All of which takes time, a very long time! My original plan back in September was to take as long as I needed and work through the sprints and the tasks at my own pace. I thought allowing 3 months should do it, surely! Well, I forgot to include one important variable into the equation - life! I'll spare you the details, as what's done is done, but it took a huge chunk of my allocated time. The time that I was going to spend on preparing for Phrase 0. I was seriously considering moving my boot camp to another date, well, by 12 months, as I can only get time off work over the summer period.
Everything turned to custard from that moment on. I lost my motivation, and most importantly my self-esteem. I knew what I needed to learn, and I also knew how I learn. Somehow the new time frame didn't add up. I should say, the new time frame doesn't add up. There're still far too many concepts to get my head around, and practise! I haven't really practiced coding, I only practised looking up other people's coding!
Yes, I've asked others in the cohort, Googled lots, watched Treehouse videos, had a go at tasks that are controlled and scaffolded. So, this is the good bit that I did in my nine sprints in Phase 0 - I never really gave up.

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

Well, I should have really resigned from my job but it's a bit difficult when you have a family, and when there's only 1 bread-winner in the household, so that wasn't the option. That option pushed aside, I think I should have spent more time repeating task, going over the videos, reading and re-reading notes... All of which takes time.

As for the boot camp, I'm really looking forward to it and I will give it my best shot. My best shot happens to be rather weak due to my lack of preparation. However, I've already made peace with myself and that I will take as long as I need AFTER the boot camp to get my skills, knowledge and experience up to scratch BEFORE embarking on web developer contracts.
I really want to get this right. I'll be turning 45 2 days before the start of the boot camp, and I'd like to spend the next 45 years of my life as a web developer. So this is more than a few thousand dollar investment for me, it is for a life time.
I think I should stop typing these lines now and push this file to GitHub before I modify the content :-)
See you soon!

What did I do well this sprint?

I managed to get a working calculator. It doesn't do everything, but I persisted with Don's help until I got something working!


What could I have done to improve?

I definitely need to spend more time in general on trying out different solutions. I'm very nervous to try things out, and also am not confident enough in my knowledge. I haven't spend enough time on the basics yet, which is disappointing.

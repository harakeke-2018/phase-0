1. What did I do well this sprint?
I am not sure if I did well. One of the slowest sprints I've had and am really worried whether I can hack the bootcamp in January. What if I get sick again during bootcamp?
2. What could have done to improve?
Not get sick. And spend more time on FreeCodeCamp...showing my addictive tendencies here: gotta get that dopamine hit when I get through a challenge and it has these weird congratulatory messages (e.g. Tubular!). XD

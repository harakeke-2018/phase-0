What did I do well this week?
I feel confident in creating my pages on my website, and linking them. Yay!
I've been practising meditation, which is calming my nerves.
I'm definitely managing my time better, though I've still got one more task, 2.5 Pay off some technical debt, to complete.
Oh, and I've increased my typing speed by 3 words a minute! Yay! 
What could I have done to improve?
I wish I had had more time to:
-investigate the sample sites on CSS Zen Garden
-watch the Udacity videos twice and put to practice what I've learnt, without referring to notes!
-I must find out how to move up a level/directory in terminal, as I find myself going back to ~/workspace and then make my way down! It's not a very 'DRY' approach!

What did I do well this week?
This week I think I did a good job on my website design - struggled with a few things but watched some youtube video tutorials in regard to skeleton and recognised where I was going wrong. It took a while to recognise that different versions of Skeleton had different commands and layouts but I got there in the end. Although I spent too long on this sprint I think I am moving on from HTML and CSS with a pretty strong understanding of the basics. I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving something unfinished and look forward to achieving the rest of the goals I had set out for my blog. I think I made a good blog template that should work for the rest of the course so am quite happy with that too.


 What could I have done to improve?

 I spent far too long working on the blog this week. I also was under a bit of pressure externally from the course with a lot of tiredness and was busy at work so ended up taking almost 2 weeks to complete one sprint. Hoping to finish the next sprint within the week. I think I could have spent more time on my typing - as usual. I have been prioritising the course work over this but need to find time to do some typing too. I also have been getting distracted a lot while working so will try a new workspace in future.

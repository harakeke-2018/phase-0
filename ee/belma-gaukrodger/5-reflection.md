What did I do well this week?
Definitely improving on the time front. Taking time off due to illness makes it difficult to concentrate on learning. But I'm getting back into it slowly. I might even catch up! I've been more proactive on the cohort Slack channel, especially in asking questions. My Googling skills are constantly improving too!

What could I have done to improve?
I definitely need to work on my terminal commands as I still make mistakes in pushing to the wrong repos! I've also been avoiding my CSS on my web site, but I do want to improve that soon.

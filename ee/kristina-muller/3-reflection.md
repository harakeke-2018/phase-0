What did I do well this week?
  This sprint my confidence has increased in my ability to read and edit the HTML and CSS files. I experimented a lot with css and trying to get my boxify items correct. I powered through this sprint and actually understood what I was supposed to be doing (even though I still need guidance and support especially when navigating between the terminal and github)

What could I have done to improve?
  Although our focus was on process not perfection, I still found myself trying to make it perfect, and spent an extra 3 hours on tweaking my CSS code because Im not sure what the correct semantic tags are to indicate how I want my site to look, so its really hard to move on when my site is looking horrid. I can defiantly improve in that area.

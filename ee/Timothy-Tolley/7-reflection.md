This week I think I was a little slow with my work progress - I was a bit slack and went away for the weekend and things which put me a bit behind. Although I think I was happy with how I understood all the function ideas which were discussed in the eloquent article and was able to finish the tasks really promptly. I struggled a little with the tasks for the freeCodeCamp exercises at first but warmed up a little toward the end. I feel like I managed alright there but will look back on those at some point and make sure I'm happy that I can do all of them relatively easily. Was happy that I was able to finish over half of the exercises in the 4 hours though as 50 hours was the suggested time on the site. Otherwise I think I could have time blocked a bit more this week rather than just working in little bits where ever suited. I will try to do that a little more next week for sure. I'm looking forward to having some solid time on the computer during bootcamp to really get to grips with it all though! Has been a busy few weeks so I am glad to have this sprint finished with only two more to go! Happy with how I am progressing but definitely looking to recap in the few weeks before bootcamp!

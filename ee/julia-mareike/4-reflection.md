What did I do well this week?

I think I did well on this sprint, though to be fair it was mostly just Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp! I had done most of the Codecademy course already which helped me get through a little faster.

I spent a little more time on the mindfulness/meditation techniques, which I hadn't really dedicated much time to in the previous sprints.

What could I have done to improve?

I could have gone a bit slower to make sure I really understood all the concepts, but as I'm trying to catch up I think I'll just have to go back and re-read the material when I need to.

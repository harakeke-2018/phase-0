What did I do well this week? What could I have done to improve?

I've been away from study for a while, which is very bad, so getting back into it was hard and took much longer than it should have. From now on things are gonna get serious, I will be much more committed and have a lot more time to spend on EDA.

Once again I spent too long stuck on small details I wanted to figure out how to do, just out of principle, and I need to be ok with leaving some things for later on once everything else makes sense. 

I set aside a good chunk of time last night to work and managed to stay focussed, which was great and very productive!

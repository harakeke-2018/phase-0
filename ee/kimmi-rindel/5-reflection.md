What did I do well this week?

Last week, nearing the end of sprint 5 I think I did pretty well with learning the new material. I expected to have this finished then but had lost time over the weekend and at the start of this week. This week (not last week), I have done somewhat alright at coming back to the work after feeling bad about it.

What could I have done to improve?

Being consistent has been hard for me. I've often slipped into prioritising my time elsewhere. Being aware of this as it happens, and probably using some foresight would have been smarter.

<h3>What did I do well this week?</h3>
<p>This week I was able to give my website a nice design update and I'm really happy that I've just managed to keep the motivation to continue on doing all my assigned tasks whenver I've been able. I'm happy I haven't yet burnt out from the high work load.</p>

<h3>What could I have done to improve?</h3>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is LEARN TO STOP TOGGL! I've left it going for 24 hours at a time at least twice this week. Also, maybe ensuring I complete my code earlier in the day when I'm in a sharper mind frame.</p>

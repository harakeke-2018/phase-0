What did I do well this week?
Not much really, other than finishing this sprint on time, I was pretty disappointed that I didn't understand that much of the content this week. I found sprint-7 really hard.



What could I have done to improve?
Maybe taken more notes, spent time on things I really didn't understand until they made sense, but I think I was getting distracted and being lazy - but I am going to set time aside over the new year to make sure I have a book full of notes and crucial things I need to prep for bootcamp.

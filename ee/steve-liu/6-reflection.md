1. What did I do well this sprint?

In this sprint, I have implemented a little game - minesweeper. During this sprint, I have learned how to interact among html, css, and javascript.
I started to develop a new habit of completing a small function each time. And I've already started to review my code. When I checked my code, I found a lot of it
The code can be optimized.

2. What didn't I do well this sprint?

Some times, I will forget the web developer's workflow, which made me very messy. I am so bad at CSS.

3. What can I improve on next sprint?

I would like to follow the web developer's workflow and improve my css skills.

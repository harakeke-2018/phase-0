What did I do well this week?
I managed to get organised as I had more time to allocate to EDA this week. I'm so glad I was able to 'catch' up in sprint-3 and not any later. It's helped me to see the big picture. I'd like to see the whole map of where I am and where I am going. Once I've established that, I was able to zoom in on the details. 
I was also able to work at a good pace this week, keeping track of time and breaks. All in all, I've really enjoyed sprint-3, with one exception...

What could I have done to improve?
Well, I managed to get stuck on the very last task of the very last assignment, 3.1 Build your redesigned site. I was not able to modify my main.css for the blog template page.
I drew the wireframes by hand, and labelled each box/frame on the page but I didn't know how to convert it to CSS.
I'll have to find out and resolve this issue as I'm sure it's absolutely essential to get it right.

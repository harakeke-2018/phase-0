What did I do well this sprint?
I've gotten slightly better at refactoring and writing cleaner code, or I at least notice when code is messy and try to clear it up.

What could I have done to improve?
Most of the time I don't really know how to clean up code and have been having trouble with indentation still. The html files for larger blog posts are messy and I've tested different ways of clearing it but have found nothing that suits me. I guess, to improve I'll need to look more into this and find a consistent, easily readable indentation style.

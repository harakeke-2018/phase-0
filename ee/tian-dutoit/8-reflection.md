Sprint 8 - Reflection

What did I do well this week?

I was happy with how I worked through blocks on the calculator assignment, often having to use the dev tools or alerts/console logs to work out where things were breaking. While it may not be the most elegant solution, I was also pleased with how I managed to get the operators to work as I couldn't get them to convert from a string.

What could I have done to improve?

Because of a combination of work, the holiday season and the start of the bootcamp fast approaching, I wasn't able to set aside time to work with a partner on the calculator assignment. It would have been useful to have someone to bounce ideas off of and to have had another chance to work in a pair. I should have also spent more time planning out how it was going to work as on review of the sample answer and other peoples assignments it looks like most people completed it in a different (and probably simpler) way - taking the inputs as a string and working from there.

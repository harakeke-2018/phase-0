Why is reflection important?

So that you can see how much you have accomplished well and what you need to work on for next time.

What did I do well this week?

Having good blocks of time working on the assignments - i've had good work 'flow'. I've made helpful notes that are great to refer to.

What could I have done to improve?

I missed a few time recordings on toggl - pausing and forgetting to resume, and will work on making sure thats what I do first. I might also write down reasons I got stuck and how to get out of it for future reference. I also think it will help to journal my progress so I can see patterns in my behaviour and notice what works best.

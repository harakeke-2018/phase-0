What did I do well this week?

This week I managed to get through the JS learning. That's about all I did well.

What could I have done to improve?

I am having a really hard time learning JS because my brain doesn't naturally pick up the language easily. I'm going to have a hard time learning JavaScript, and would never have got through the exercises without being able to look at the answers. It also has taken weeks to get through this sprint which I'm disappointed about.

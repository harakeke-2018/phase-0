What did I do well this week?

I came into EDA and got help from Don to complete Sprint 6. I did most of it in a day and now just need to finish tasks which are optional (though which I should probably do). I was proud of myself for not crying even though I didn't understand at all and was very stressed, lol. Also I'm proud of how I tried to assemble the different parts of each question even if I couldn't complete it.



What could I do to improve?

I think I could try out more things before giving up or getting help. I also need to write a comprehensive guide, where I completely make a program, then list out exactly why I did each part in the notes.

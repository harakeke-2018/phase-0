This week I think I managed to put in a fair amount of hours and managed to understand most of what was happening with the new javascript content. I feel like I will need to go back at look at the nitty gritty again as I try to use the javascript within my code but was pleasantly surprised that I could answer most of the tech blog questions without looking elsewhere too much. I am glad I took the time to sit and read the meditation chapter this week properly and enjoyed the time lying down reading with a purpose. 

I think I still need to work on learning the proper touch typing technique but am happy with how I am progressing in terms of my typing speed. I have been pretty exhausted and busy so am looking forward to finishing the next sprint in good time. I need to read a bit more of the material when I can too as I didn't get to much of it this sprint as I was trying to power through the workload.

# Sprint 7 Reflection

**What did I do well this week?**

I was really pleased to learn about APIs, AJAX and JSON then successfully apply that learning to the Whakatauki project which I undertook. Although I've had a Twitter account for a number of years, it has received very little usage until this week. Adding a Tweet button to the Whakatauki app was both interesting and rewarding when I finally got things working the way I wanted.


**What could I have done to improve?**

Probably spending a little more time preparing and planning before coding. Also, I need to slow down a bit and not sit developing my projects when I'm really tired and would benefit more from sleeping. I didn't do any pairing as part of Sprint 7, but will be available to work with someone else when they are ready.

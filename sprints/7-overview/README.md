## Assignments and resources
Find your assignments on your cohort's waffle board. **You must filter by your GitHub user name (see example below)** - find them at<br> `https://waffle.io/`**cohort-year**`/`**cohort-year**`?assigned=`**yourGitHubUserName**
<br>
You will need to replace 'cohort-year' and 'GitHubUserName', for example:<br> `https://waffle.io/kakapo-2016/kakapo-2016?assigned=anahera`
In some cases, if you feel confident about the weekly concepts, you can skip straight to the assignments.

## Next steps
1. Read the concepts and their respective capabilities
2. Check out your assignments on the waffle board
3. Complete the assignments!
4. **(Optional)** When convenient, Dive into the resources to develop your capabilities (linked from within the concepts)

## Handing in your work
- Check off all tasks within the assignments in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Move each of your assignments to the "Done" column in Waffle.io as you complete them
- Make sure you post a link to your completed work in the comments of the waffle ticket!

## Blocked
- If you find yourself blocked on a task, add a comment describing the error / problems you are having with the specific task, and move it to the "Blocked" column on Waffle.io
- Send your facilitator a message on slack if you don't hear from them within a day or so
- Move on to another task if possible, rather than waiting and not achieving anything
- Ask for help in your cohorts slack channel, someone will surely be willing to help you out!

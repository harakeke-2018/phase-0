What did I do well this week?
I kept up with my meditation except for 1 day. I made a good effort to go through all the resources in order to understand the concepts.

What could I have done to improve?
I think I should schedule out timeboxes better. Some days it worked and other days if I was "on a roll" I'd keeping working beyound my allotted time. But I had nothing scheduled after my working time. So maybe I could timebox something immediately after working, so I don't get dragged in to putting in longer hours than needed.

Why is reflection important?
Reflection allows you the space and time to 'step back' from any possible problems. Additionally, putting how you feel into words is helpful to create a distance between yourself and those feelings, and look at them from a different perspective.

What did I do well this week?
I've done my best to commit to my allocated dev time in a busy schedule.

What could I have done to improve?
I find myself continually making the same silly mistakes over again and wasting time doing this. I think it would be best to work on being less hasty and to ask for more help.

# Reflection

## Why is reflection important?   
- It will reinforce what you've learned. Otherwise you will forget them after a few days.

- By thinking of what you've done, you may come up with deeper understanding or batter ideas.


## What did I do well this week?   
- To be honest, I didn't do well this week, been trapped by many personal things. The good part is I will have enough time to study for the following week.


## What could I have done to improve?     
- I found the time and habits part are quite useful.   
I will try to use POMODORO technique and make small change triggered by the exist habits.

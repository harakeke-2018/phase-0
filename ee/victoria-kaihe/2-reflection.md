What did I do well this week?
I definitely had a better idea of how to approach the material this week. I've been trying really hard to practice being mindful and monitoring my emotions throughout each day. I tried using a Pomodoro Chrome extension this week but honestly I didn't really like it. I just found it annoying, and prefer to monitor my work and breaks myself.

What could I have done to improve?
I wasn't as focused as I would have like to be, and took far longer on this sprint than I'd hoped. I also wanted to try fitting in short, intense workouts this week, because it helps improve my mood and focus, but I just couldn't get it in. Next week I'm going to really make the most of every minute I have, and push myself harder.

1. Reflection is very important to my. It is the record of my work and feelings. It keeps track of the good and bad things i do in my work. Based on these records, I have the opportunity to improve my skills and working methods.

2. In this week, I have learned how to manage files including code, documents, and so on using Github, and I also practiced linux command line. Although both them are new things to me, I spent less time on learning them than I thought.

3. Writing blog took me a lot of time. My english writing is so poor and I must improve it to keep up with the progress of the task.

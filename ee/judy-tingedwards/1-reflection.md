1. Why is reflection important?

  Reflections assist with learning as it provides you an opportunity to review what you have learnt (space recognition is important to help memory)

2. What did I do well this week?

  I am not sure whether I have done anything well this week. I have completed about 80% of the assignment without mucking too much up (I think)...

3. What could I have done to improve?
  Put more time aside to work on the problems. Work on another problem when I get stuck rather than suffering through it for too long.

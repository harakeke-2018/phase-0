1. What did I do well this sprint?

In this sprint, I have completed a javascript calculator. The logic of calculator running is not easy. Every time i only achieve a small function. I overcame the pursuit of perfection  and mpatience. When I did that, I found that I actually spent less time than expected.

2. What didn't I do well this sprint?

When I planed to implement the function of handling the math operators input, I intended to use regular expression to check whether or not the input charactar is a math operator. 
Because I thought that regular expression would be clearer and shorter the length of the code. But I was not able to develop a regular express that could validate the input.

3. What can I improve on next sprint?

I need to programming using javascript more and more.

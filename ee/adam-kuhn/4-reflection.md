What did I do well this week?
I was better at taking intentional brakes when I could not figure out a problem. I was also much better at taking notes as I worked through the tutorials.

What could I do to improve?
I need to remember to make commits when I am working on my blog posts. This week I forgot to make any commits, till I completed both blog posts.
